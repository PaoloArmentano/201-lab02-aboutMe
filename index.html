    <h3>Bio</h3>
        <p>I was born in Italy in 1994, I grew up in a small village just outside Milan. When I was 15 I discovered my passion for the guitar which I decided to pursue as a career. At the age of 19 I enrolled into university studying Jazz&Pop guitar, only to drop out a year later to move to London and become a guitar teacher, which I was until February 2023</p>
